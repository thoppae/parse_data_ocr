# PDF Data Extraction to Google Sheets with Google Cloud Document AI and gspread

This notebook demonstrates how to extract structured data from a PDF document using Google Cloud Document AI and then load that extracted data into a Google Sheet using the `gspread` library.

## Process Overview

The notebook follows these main steps:

1.  Install and Import Libraries:** Installs necessary Python libraries including `google-cloud-documentai` for PDF processing, `gspread` for interacting with Google Sheets, and `oauth2client` for authentication.
2.  Authenticate with Google Cloud and Google Sheets:** Authenticates the Colab environment to access Google Cloud services (for Document AI) and Google Sheets using `google.colab.auth` and `gspread`.
3.  Configure Document AI:** Sets up the Document AI client by providing the Google Cloud project ID, location, and the specific processor ID to be used for PDF analysis.
4.  Process PDF with Document AI:** Reads the target PDF file and sends it to the configured Document AI processor for analysis and data extraction.
5.  Parse Document AI Response:** Extracts the relevant data (headers and values) from the structured response provided by Document AI.
6.  Prepare Data for Google Sheets:** Formats the extracted data into a list of lists, suitable for updating a Google Sheet row-wise (headers in the first row, values in the second).
7.  Load Data into Google Sheets:** Opens the specified Google Sheet using `gspread`, creates a new worksheet (or uses an existing one), and populates it with the prepared header and value data.

## Libraries Used

*   `google-cloud-documentai`: For intelligent document processing and data extraction from PDFs.
*   `gspread`: For interacting with Google Sheets.
*   `oauth2client`: For authentication with Google services.
*   `google.colab.auth`: For authenticating within the Google Colab environment.

This notebook provides a practical example of automating data extraction from documents and integrating it with Google Sheets workflows.
